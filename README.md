A simple JavaScript Rock Paper Scissors game for The Odin Project, revisited with an added GUI. I've come a long way in the short time since I first tackled the project, as the previous commits surely demonstrate (I didn't even know how to create a proper commit message, it was a disaster!) I've learned to clean up code (drastically), manipulate the DOM with JavaScript, and use branches with Git.
